# 2023.2.7 Meeting

### Research question 
> Has to have more than marginal contribution; Try to differenciate with similiar research works 
> Research question should be relevant, interesting, and not answered yet. Research question comes first, then the technical details.
* Read/Cite more literature to structure the contribution
* Strengthen the theory, link the theory with prior literature  
### Empirical analysis
> Try to replicate one of the paper first, i.e., the same data and procedure
> Strategy, consider the multiple shocks and the effect of shock in prior terms
> Don't worry about the setting, the most interesting part is the governance mechanism, and answer the research question, whether and how? 
### Next meeting: March 1st 16:00
